## Java problems.
### Note to myself.
When doing a new probelm explain when/why the technique is useful. Especially do this for the collections excercizes.

## Map/Collection notes:

Basic way to think about collections:
# Does this collection need key value pairs or not?
Do key/value pairs need to be stored together?
