## About this repo
The purpose of this repo is to hold solutions to problems done on various programmer websites. I like leetcode the best, so most of the problems are from there. Most of the stuff is in java and python. I try and mix it up with my practice. I have projects such as kickballin.io and the former globati.com. The effort done here is to work on the fundamentals of using data structures and writing algorithms to solve problems.
