## About this repo
The purpose of this repo is to hold solutions to problems done on various programmer websites. I like leetcode the best, so lately I have been using this website the most however there are lots of problems from other places too. Most of the stuff is in java and python. I try and mix it up with my practice. I have projects such as kickballin.io and the former globati.com. With these projects I have focused on practicing with the technologies used in software engineering including javascript frameworks, cloud, terraform, docker, junit, jest, CI/CD pipelines etc. Aside from these projects I have this repo. The effort done in this repo is to work on the fundamentals of using data structures and writing algorithms to solve problems. I'm more active in this repo when I dont have a specific project I am working on or have down time for whatever reason.
