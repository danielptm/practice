## About this repo
The purpose of this repo is to hold solutions to problems done on various programmer websites. There are also some other folders for random other things. One in particular is a folder I use to practice concepts presented in the effective java book.  I like leetcode the best, so lately I have been using this website the most however there are lots of problems from other places too. Most of the stuff is in java and python.  The effort done in this repo is to work on the fundamentals of using data structures and writing algorithms to solve problems. I'm more active in this repo when I dont have a specific project I am working on or have down time for whatever reason. If you're a recruiter or somebody who is interested in looking at this repo to see my coding ability then I would suggest focusing on the java folder.
